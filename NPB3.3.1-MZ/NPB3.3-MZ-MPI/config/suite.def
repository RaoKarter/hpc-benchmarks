# config/suite.def
# This file is used to build several benchmarks with a single command. 
# Typing "make suite" in the main directory will build all the benchmarks
# specified in this file. 
# Each line of this file contains a benchmark name, class, and number
# of nodes. The name is one of "sp-mz", "bt-mz", and "lu-mz". 
# The class is one of "S", "W", and "A" through "F". 
# No blank lines. 
# The following example builds serial sample sizes of all benchmarks.
